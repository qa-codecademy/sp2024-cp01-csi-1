    <h2 class="subHeading">What is Cryptocurrency?</h2>
    <div class="textInput">
      <p class="text">
        Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual form of currency that relies on
        cryptographic techniques to secure transactions, control the creation
        of new units, and verify the transfer of assets. Unlike traditional
        currencies issued by governments (like dollars or euros),
        cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks based on blockchain
        technology—a distributed ledger enforced by a network of computers
        (nodes).

    <div class="textInput">
      <h3 class="h3">Payments</h3>
      <p class="anwser">
        Cryptocurrencies can be used for peer-to-peer transactions, enabling
        users to send and receive payments without intermediaries like banks.
        This is particularly useful for international transfers, which can be
        faster and cheaper compared to traditional methods.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="textInput">
      <h3 class="h3">Investment</h3>
      <p class="anwser">
        Many people buy cryptocurrencies as an investment, hoping that their
        value will increase over time. The volatile nature of cryptocurrency
        markets, however, means that this can be a high-risk endeavor.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="textInput">
      <h3 class="h3">Smart Contracts</h3>
      <p class="anwser">
        Platforms like Ethereum enable the creation of smart
        contracts—self-executing contracts with the terms directly written
        into code. These contracts automatically execute and enforce
        agreements when predefined conditions are met.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="textInput">
      <h3 class="h3">Decentralized Finance (DeFi)</h3>
      <p class="anwser">
        DeFi is a rapidly growing sector that aims to recreate traditional
        financial systems (lending, borrowing, trading, insurance) using
        decentralized blockchain technology. It operates without
        intermediaries, offering greater accessibility and potentially lower
        costs.
